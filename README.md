Stunting Prevention App
Description: Pelita Stunting Prevention App

The Pelita Stunting Prevention App is a dedicated and innovative mobile application designed to address the critical issue of stunting in communities. Stunting, often resulting from malnutrition and inadequate healthcare during the early stages of life, can have long-term consequences on a child's physical and cognitive development. The Pelita app aims to combat this challenge by providing accessible information, resources, and support to parents, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

**Educational Content:** The app features engaging and informative content on the importance of early childhood nutrition, health, and hygiene. Interactive modules and videos empower users with knowledge to make informed decisions about their child's well-being.

**Community Support:** Pelita fosters a sense of community by connecting parents and caregivers with local healthcare professionals, nutritionists, and support groups. Users can share experiences, seek advice, and participate in forums to enhance their understanding of stunting prevention.
